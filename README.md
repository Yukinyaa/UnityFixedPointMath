# About
This library implements "Fix64", a 64 bit fixed point 31.32 numeric type and transcendent operations on it (square root, trig, etc).
This project is forked from https://github.com/asik/FixedMath.Net, and is converted as unitypackage to be used in Unity with ease.

## Features

Basic Fix64 operations like `+` `-` `/` `*` `%` `>`  and some basic functions like `Log` `Sin` etc.  Ported to make deterministic system for lock-step game.
Designed to use deterministic fixed points in all operations.
